# 30 day map challenge 2021

I'm following last year's 30 day map challenge (see (https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge)[https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge]) in order to practise and improve my mapping skills in R and to practise using github for version control.

Expect this to take more than 30 days. Also expect terrible code and version control practises!
